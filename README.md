I am looking foward seeing people use it but my code may rise questions: feel free to ask.

these files are the programs used for the article https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03899

It is a package of robust algorithms.
One can find:
- ROBIN (initialisation procedure)
- TClust (gaussian mixture model with trimming, EM algo)
- trimKmeans (gaussian mixture model with trimming, EM algo)
- SMM (student mixture model, EM algo)
- K-bMOM (a mix between kmeans and the estimator MOM (median-of-means))

To use it. Download all file and put them in a folder.
